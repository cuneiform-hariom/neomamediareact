                                <p>Arena Animation's biggest challenge was SEO. After considerable investigation and evaluating
                                    the latest data analytics, we found that their website needed on-page and off-page SEO.
                                    Arena's main objective was to exhibit its actual offerings and prospects through trust and
                                    organic growth. Most competitors generate much of their leads through paid marketing.
                                    Long-term organic growth in Google search results, conserving money on paid advertising, and
                                    generating search engine-optimized leads are their key problems. </p>

                                    <h4>SEO Off-Page</h4>
                                    <p>Backlinks are references to other websites' hyperlinks. They open your pages when
                                        clicked. Off-page SEO increases website visibility and builds backlinks from social
                                        media and new websites. Off-page optimization in search engine optimization (SEO) boosts
                                        a website's authority and trustworthiness with search engines and users. </p>

                                        <li>A Backlink Audit Report for Arena Animation was created.</li>
                                        <li> An examination of Arena Animation's backlink profile.</li>
                                        <li> There was a moderate degree of backlink activity on their pages.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Several important marketing factors influenced the result. Domain strength, page strength, doing-follow or no-follow backlinks, referring page URL, page title, and top anchor by backlinks were taken into account.  </p>
                                    <p>Friendly links, on-page link structure, and Google Core web vitals—email privacy, lab data, mobile viewports, and speed insights—were analyzed. After analyzing their backlink audit report, we decided to use more off-page SEO methods to increase our external traffic. </p>
