                <p>Sankalp, a famous packaged food company, pioneered exquisite dining. Sankalp offers a variety
                  of "Ready-to-Eat" foods to institutional and retail consumers with a focus on flavor and
                  quality. The firm is a leading North Indian and South Indian instant food manufacturer in
                  India. Neoma Media, a digital marketing company, helped Sankalp achieve 20% organic sales
                  growth.</p>
                <p>Sankalp was already a culinary pioneer known for its product perfection. They had loyal
                  customers who loved their ready-to-eat North Indian and South Indian dinners. Despite its
                  culinary skills and high-quality services, Sankalp struggled to expand its audience and
                  revenues.</p>

                <h3 className="cttle">THE CHALLENGE</h3>
                <p>In the highly competitive packaged food industry, where customers have many options, it might
                  be hard to succeed. Sankalp realized they needed to boost their online presence, brand
                  awareness, and organic sales to overcome this obstacle.</p>
                <div className="bulletlist">
                  <h4>Understanding the Competitive Environment:</h4>
                  <p>With so many actors and changing customer tastes, the packaged food market was dynamic.
                    Sankalp competed with known and new brands.</p>

                <div className="bulletlist">
                  <h4>Online Visibility:</h4>
                  <p>As more people use the internet to research and buy products, online visibility becomes
                    crucial. Existing consumers love Sankalp's "Ready to Eat" food selection. The goal was
                    to expand this success to attract people looking for fast, high-quality food. For this,
                    they needed a thorough digital marketing approach.</p>
                </div>
                <div className="bulletlist">
                  <h4>Driving Organic Sales Growth:</h4>
                  <p>Sankalp wanted to increase sales and develop a long-term relationship with its audience
                    in a trust-based market. This required focusing on organic sales development, where
                    buyers were lured to their products through sponsored marketing and genuine interest in
                    the brand and its services. This required a systematic, data-driven approach to create
                    leads and turn them into loyal clients.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Sankalp found it necessary to adjust to the evolving packaged food industry due to strong
                  competition. Their reputation for culinary excellence and product quality was established,
                  but they needed to expand to succeed in the digital age.</p>
                <p>Due to the need for increased online visibility and organic sales growth, Sankalp partnered
                  with Neoma. Their partnership launched the brand's makeover. Neoma understood that Sankalp's
                  strengths and internet development potential required a multifaceted approach.</p>
