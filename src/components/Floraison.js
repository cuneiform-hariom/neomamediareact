                                <h3 className="cttle">THE CHALLENGE</h3>
                                <p>Floraison's unique approach to Ayurvedic personal care products makes it a market leader. They had some trouble with their web marketing strategy, though. They came to the conclusion that they had a significant market share in the online sphere of their sector based on customer satisfaction with every component of their product.</p>

                                    <h4>Let's examine a few issues they face in their digital ecosystem.</h4>
                                    <p>Because the page load speed has not been optimized, customers found it challenging to browse through the various product categories when they visited the website. Additionally, there were a few problems with off-page and on-page SEO.</p>
                                    <p>Using a range of gadgets, including a laptop, tablet, and phone, users peruse websites to make a variety of purchases. The constant battle for improved user experience and satisfaction when browsing the website is device optimization.</p>
                                    <p>In a culture where competition is fierce, it becomes imperative to reach the customer before the rival website. A limited consumer reach can be caused by a few obstacles, like not running paid advertisements and having a low website position.</p>
                                    <p>The decrease in the total order count was attributed to social media platforms' limited capacity to generate organic traffic and their limited ability to reach potential clients in the herbal care sector.</p>
                                    <p>The absence of sponsored marketing was another factor that lowered lead generation rates.</p>

                                    <p>To create a stronger marketing strategy, we studied and analysed the herbal care industry. We not only carried out research but also a comprehensive audit of their internet business strategy to pinpoint areas of weakness and potential remedies that could yield exceptional outcomes.</p>
                                    <p>We made significant enhancements to the website's overall SEO and page load speed to boost organic traffic and support the organization's long-term development.</p>
                                    <p>In order to simplify the user experience for users across several devices, we integrated and modified the website interface.</p>
                                    <p>To understand user metrics behaviour, we examined website traffic and parameters to find out how people visit the website over a given period of time. Better forecasting of our team's marketing initiatives results from this as well.</p>
                                    <p>Based on marketing KPIs like click-through rate, conversion rate, and social media traffic, we created a number of practical strategies for paid advertising and social media advertising campaigns, which enhanced audience reach in various Indian states.</p>
                                    <p>We developed Floraison's paid campaigns and increased their orders by employing the best digital technologies available on the market.</p>
                                    <p>At last, following exceptional outcomes with sponsored ads and SEO. In an effort to reach more Indians, we are shifting our focus to influencer marketing.</p>
